# Sensor Fusion (Udacity)

### Lidar Obstacle Detection

Process raw lidar data with filtering, segmentation, and clustering to detect other vehicles on the road. Implement Ransac with planar model fitting to segment point clouds. Euclidean clustering with a KD-Tree was implemented to cluster and distinguish vehicles and obstacles.

Main components of this project: 
- Plane Segmentation with RANSAC
- Euclidean clustering with KD-Tree
- Reading and streaming PCDs
