### Lidar Obstacle Detection

Process raw lidar data with filtering, segmentation, and clustering to detect other vehicles on the road. Understand how to implement Ransac with planar model fitting to segment point clouds. Also implement Euclidean clustering with a KD-Tree to cluster and distinguish vehicles and obstacles.
